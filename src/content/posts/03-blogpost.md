# Chest

> All the stats given below are honest and based on my last push day. 

After a decent push day warmup. I start my exercise with the Flat barbell bench press which primarily targets the Pectoralis Major part of the chest along with your triceps and deltoids. 

## Flat barbell benchpress:

### Current Stats:

- [x] `Warm up 40kgs * 15`

- [x] `Set - 1 45kgs * 15`

- [x] `Set - 2 50kgs * 12`

- [x] `Set - 3 55kgs * 10`

- [x] `Set - 4 60kgs * 08`


### Modifications:

- Can be performed using dumbbells.

- For more focus on triceps, a close-grip variation can be used.

Doing this takes me 20-30 mins ðŸ•¥ lmao. The next one After this is the Incline dumbell bench press.

## Incline Dumbell Bench Press:

The incline dumbbell bench press is another popular exercise that targets the upper chest muscles but also involves the shoulders and triceps. This one primarily targets the Upper Pectoralis Major muscle. 

### Current Stats:

- [x] `Warm up 2x15kgs   * 15`

- [x] `Set - 1 2x17.5kgs * 15`

- [x] `Set - 2 2x20kgs   * 12`

- [x] `Set - 3 2x22.5kgs * 12`

- [x] `Set - 4 2x25kgs   * 10` -> `Drop - 2x15kgs` -> `Drop - 2x10kgs`

### Modifications:

- Varying the angle of the incline bench can emphasize different parts of the chest. 

- Can be performed with a barbell instead of dumbbells.

Even this eats alot of time at the gym lol. I like to take rests according to my muscle go give the upcoming set my all.

The rest of my chest exercises are of cable and machine.

First Cable exercise is of lower chest of 3 total sets with a super set at the end with a machine. The second cable exercise is of a Pectoralis Major of 3 Sets with a superset at the end with a machine.

I think doing these 4 covers your whole chest and gets you ready to go all in for the next chest workout. In my case I do PPL 2 times a week so I will be going to do Push again on the 3rd day.

# Tricep

The starting exerice should be the one which requires lot of power. like for chest Its benchs before cable. the same for tricep here.

## Skull Crusher

Interesting name for a exercise but Its hard to add more weight to it. The primary target of this exercise is Triceps Brachii. its also involves shoulder and forerarm too but not as mush as the tricep.

### Current Stats:

- [x] `Set - 1 13kgs * 15`

- [x] `set - 2 18kgs * 12`

- [x] `Set - 3 21kgs * 10`

### Modifications:

- Dumbbells can be used instead of a barbell for an added stabilization challenge.

- Variations like incline or decline bench angles target the triceps differently.

## Close Grip Bench Press:

The close grip bench press is a variation of the standard bench press that emphasizes the triceps more than the wider grip versions. By bringing the hands closer together on the barbell, the exercise targets the triceps while still working the chest and shoulders. 

### Current Stats:

- [x] `Set - 1 28kgs * 15`

- [x] `Set - 2 31kgs * 12`

- [x] `Set - 3 35kgs * 10`

### Benefits:

>Increased triceps strength and mass.
>Variation to the standard bench press, adding diversity to your workout.
>Improved stability and support for other pressing movements.

And My last 2 tricep workouts are done on cable. I take some good weight on those ones too but I dont think Its worth talking about because they're the most common ones . My last 2 exercises are Rope pulldown and bar pulldown with doing a tricep bent over extension as superset for both the exercies one with rope one with bar.
