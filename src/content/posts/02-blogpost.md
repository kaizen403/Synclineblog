## Specifications about this site:

I got halfway through my blog project with Nextjs13, but dang, it was giving me tons of issues with storing blog posts. I mean, I'm a Nextjs fan, don't get me wrong, but Astro does have some good features for blogs that make life easier. Yeah, there was still backend stuff to figure out, but not as much as nextjs. Both frameworks have their strengths, but personally, I'm still a Nextjs guy.

Now, check this out - this site is built with some rad, dev-friendly tech. Underneath it all, I'm running **Astro**. It's this fresh front-end framework that helps me build speedy, optimized sites and apps. I chose Astro 'cause it gets the job done using less client-side JavaScript, making the site snappier and more efficient.

For the app logic, I'm using **TypeScript**. Think of it like JavaScript's brainy cousin - a statically typed version that brings up the quality and predictability of the code. TypeScript's strong typing is awesome 'cause it helps me spot bugs or issues early in the dev process, making my code safer and more reliable.

On the CSS front, I'm all about **Tailwind**. It's a super customizable, utility-first CSS framework. It lets me build unique, responsive UIs directly from my HTML. Tailwind gives me full control over the site's aesthetics, while making my CSS tidy and easy to manage.

And when it comes to data validation, I'm using **Zod**. It's a TypeScript-centric library for declaring and validating data schemas. With Zod, I can easily define my data structures, giving me static type safety and handy tools for validating data when it really counts.

By combining Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Zod, we have created a robust and high-performing platform that balances cutting-edge technology with developer productivity and efficiency. This powerful combination ensures that our site is not only fast and user-friendly, but also built to withstand the test of time, maintaining its reliability and performance as it grows and evolves.
